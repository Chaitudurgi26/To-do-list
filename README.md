### HTML
1. **Structure**: Use HTML to create the basic structure of your to-do list. This includes an input field for adding new tasks, a button to submit the tasks, and a section to display the list of tasks.

### CSS
2. **Styling**: Apply CSS to style your to-do list. This includes setting up the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing to make your list visually appealing. You might want to style the input field, buttons, and the list items differently to improve usability and appearance.

### JavaScript
3. **Interactivity**: Use JavaScript to add functionality to your to-do list. This involves:
   - Capturing the input from the user when they add a new task.
   - Creating new list items dynamically and appending them to the task list.
   - Adding features such as marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and possibly editing tasks.
   - Storing the tasks in local storage so that they persist even when the page is reloaded
